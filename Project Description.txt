Project Description:

We need to scrape the VAT number from ebay listings that we have purchased in the past, by providing the ebay item number.
e.g input file contains one column of Ebay Item Numbers:
291602157755

Script checks ebay UK and finds "VAT number: UK 860487994" in the listing. Then puts item number and VAT number in two columns in output file. e.g:
291602157755 UK 860487994

To be run manually, happy for web script or exe to run on windows.

If you can complete this then please place a bid.
Thanks
